# Random Walks on Protein Structure Networks

This is my research project at ThayerLab, where I've been working since the Summer of 2024. My aim is to prove that running random walks is more efficient (both in runtime and storage space) than molecular dynamics simulations and that this method can help characterize allostery in proteins.
